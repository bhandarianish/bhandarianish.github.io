I graduated from University of Texas at Arlington in 2006 with a B.S in Biochemistry. I received my MBA from Texas Woman's University in 2013. I'm enrolled in SMU's Masters of Data Science program with the expected graduation on Dec 2024. I am an American Society for Quality certified Six Sigma Black Belt and Quality Engineer. I currently work for BASF as their Global Quality Management Specialist. My previous experiences include Quality Manager for Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Quality Manager for Hexion, Quality Engineer for MillerCoors Brewery, and Analytical Chemist for Air Products.




I currently reside in Katy, Texas with my wife and two children. In my spare time, I love playing basketball, soccer, poker etc. with my friends and families. My favorite sports teams are Dallas Cowboys, Houston Astros and Dallas Mavericks.
